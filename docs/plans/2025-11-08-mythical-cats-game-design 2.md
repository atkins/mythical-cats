# Mythical Cats Idle Game - Design Document

**Project Name:** (To be determined)
**Genre:** Incremental/Idle Game
**Platform:** Web (primary), Android, iOS
**Framework:** Flutter
**Theme:** Greek Mythology with Divine Cats
**Design Date:** 2025-11-08

## Overview

A deep, Kittens Game-inspired idle game where players take the role of a minor deity collecting mythical cats to ascend to Mount Olympus. Features complex resource management, a tech tree, prestige mechanics, and progression through the favor of the 12 Olympian gods.

## Core Concept & Player Journey

**You are a minor deity** in the Greek mythological world, blessed with the divine ability to summon and accumulate sacred cats. Your ultimate goal is to ascend to Mount Olympus and claim your place among the immortals.

**Primary gameplay:** Click/tap to perform divine rituals that summon cats. Cats are your main currency - spend them to build shrines, temples, and other divine structures that automatically generate more cats. Progress through the favor of the 12 Olympian gods, each introducing new mechanics, resources, and cat types.

**Long-term progression:** When you've reached certain milestones, you can choose to reincarnate - resetting your progress but gaining permanent bonuses tied to primordial forces (Chaos, Gaia, Nyx, Erebus, etc.). Each reincarnation cycle represents a different mythological age with unique modifiers and unlocks.

**Core loop:**
1. Perform rituals (click) to summon cats
2. Spend cats on buildings that auto-generate cats
3. Unlock new Olympian gods (linear progression)
4. Manage tiered resources to research upgrades
5. Eventually reincarnate for permanent bonuses
6. Push deeper into the pantheon with each cycle

## Resource System & Progression Tiers

**Cats** are the primary currency - the number you're trying to maximize. Everything either costs cats or helps you generate cats.

**Tiered supporting resources unlock as you progress:**

### Tier 1 (Starting resources)
- **Offerings** - Basic resource from simple shrines. Used for early buildings and upgrades.
- **Prayers** - Generated by ritual actions and prayer structures. Fuel early research.

### Tier 2 (Unlocked through mid-game gods)
- **Divine Essence** - Refined spiritual energy. Required for advanced temples and god-specific buildings.
- **Ambrosia** - Food of the gods. Needed for powerful upgrades and favor mechanics.

### Tier 3 (Late-game resources)
- **Ichor** - Blood of immortals. Extremely rare, unlocks prestige-level content.
- **Celestial Fragments** - Pieces of divine power. Required for approaching Olympus.

Each resource tier comes with its own production buildings, tech tree branches, and strategic decisions. You're not managing all resources from the start - they naturally introduce complexity as you progress through the Olympians.

**Resource chains exist:** Some buildings convert lower-tier resources into higher-tier ones (Offerings → Divine Essence), creating strategic optimization opportunities later in the game.

## Building System

**Hybrid building structure** that starts simple and expands into variety:

### Generic shrine/temple tiers (available from start)
- **Small Shrine** (15 cats) - Generates 0.1 cats/sec
- **Temple** (100 cats) - Generates 1 cat/sec
- **Grand Sanctuary** (1,000 cats) - Generates 8 cats/sec
- **Sacred Acropolis** (15,000 cats) - Generates 47 cats/sec
- *(Scales up with increasingly large costs and returns)*

### God-specific buildings (unlock with each Olympian)
Each of the 12 gods introduces a unique building tied to their domain:
- **Hermes:** Messenger Waystation - Boosts offline progression efficiency
- **Athena:** Hall of Wisdom - Reduces research costs
- **Ares:** War Monument - Increases ritual click power
- **Aphrodite:** Garden of Beauty - Generates passive Ambrosia
- *(Each god adds their signature building with unique benefits)*

### Functional buildings (unlock through tech tree)
- **Workshops** - Convert base resources into refined resources
- **Academies** - Generate research points for tech tree
- **Altars** - Build favor with specific gods
- **Breeding Grounds** - Late-game: combine cat types for bonuses

Early game is just buying shrine tiers. Mid-game adds god buildings for strategic choices. Late-game layers in functional buildings for resource conversion and optimization.

## The 12 Olympians - Linear Progression

Each Olympian god unlocks at specific milestones (total cats collected, buildings built, etc.) and introduces new mechanics:

### Early Game Gods (1-4)
1. **Hermes** (Start) - God of travelers. Unlocks: offline progression, basic temples, Offerings resource
2. **Hestia** (~1,000 cats) - Goddess of hearth. Unlocks: Workshop buildings, home/comfort mechanics
3. **Demeter** (~10,000 cats) - Goddess of harvest. Unlocks: Prayers resource, seasonal cycles/bonuses
4. **Dionysus** (~100,000 cats) - God of celebration. Unlocks: festival events, temporary boosts

### Mid Game Gods (5-8)
5. **Athena** (~1M cats) - Goddess of wisdom. Unlocks: Tech tree research, Divine Essence, Academy buildings
6. **Apollo** (~10M cats) - God of light/prophecy. Unlocks: prophecy system (forecasts production), oracle mechanics
7. **Artemis** (~100M cats) - Goddess of hunt. Unlocks: active hunting mini-game for bonus resources
8. **Ares** (~1B cats) - God of war. Unlocks: conquest system, Ambrosia resource

### Late Game Gods (9-12)
9. **Hephaestus** (~10B cats) - God of forge. Unlocks: artifact crafting, equipment systems
10. **Aphrodite** (~100B cats) - Goddess of love. Unlocks: cat breeding/genetics system
11. **Poseidon** (~1T cats) - God of sea. Unlocks: naval exploration, new realms
12. **Zeus** (~10T cats) - King of gods. Unlocks: path to ascension, Ichor resource, final challenges

Each god brings meaningful new mechanics, not just bigger numbers.

## Reincarnation - Prestige System

### When can you reincarnate?
After reaching Athena (god #5) and accumulating at least 1 million total cats, you unlock the ability to reincarnate. You can choose to reincarnate anytime after that threshold.

### What happens when you reincarnate
- Reset almost everything: cats, buildings, resources, god progression
- Keep: unlocked tech tree nodes, certain permanent upgrades
- Gain: Primordial Essence based on total cats collected (logarithmic scale)

### Primordial Essence
Spent to choose your patron primordial force for the next cycle:

**The Primordial Forces:**
- **Chaos** - Grants increased click power and random event frequency
- **Gaia** - Boosts building efficiency and resource generation
- **Nyx** - Enhances offline progression and nighttime bonuses
- **Erebus** - Increases rare resource drops and Ichor gain
- **Tartarus** - High risk/reward: volatile bonuses and penalties
- **Aether** - Celestial focus: faster god unlock progression

You can invest Primordial Essence into permanent upgrades for each force (skill tree style), and choose which force to be reborn under each cycle. Different forces synergize with different playstyles.

**Later reincarnation tiers unlock:** After multiple reincarnations, you unlock deeper prestige layers (perhaps Titan reincarnations, then Olympian reincarnations) with even more powerful permanent upgrades.

## Research & Tech Tree

### How research works
- Unlock research through Athena (god #5)
- Research nodes cost specific resources (Prayers, Divine Essence, cats, etc.)
- Research has prerequisites - you must complete certain nodes before accessing others
- Research is permanent and persists through reincarnation

### Tech tree structure organized by themes

**Foundation Branch:**
- Divine Architecture I/II/III → Unlocks higher tier shrine buildings
- Sacred Geometry → Required for god-specific buildings
- Immortal Craftsmanship → Unlocks Workshop buildings

**Resource Branch:**
- Essence Refinement → Unlock Divine Essence production
- Nectar Brewing → Unlock Ambrosia production
- Divine Alchemy → Resource conversion efficiency
- Ichor Extraction → Unlock Ichor (requires Zeus)

**Automation Branch:**
- Auto-Rituals → Passive click generation
- Divine Oversight → Buildings run at increased efficiency
- Celestial Clockwork → Time-based bonuses

**God Favor Branch:**
- Olympian Devotion → Unlock Altar buildings
- Pantheon Mastery → Earn favor faster
- Divine Blessings → Gods grant passive bonuses

**Advanced Branches (late game):**
- Breeding Science → Cat genetics system (requires Aphrodite)
- Conquest Tactics → Battle/war mechanics (requires Ares)
- Void Knowledge → Reincarnation bonuses

Prerequisites create strategic planning: "I need Divine Architecture II to unlock Grand Sanctuaries, but that requires Sacred Geometry first."

## UI/UX Design - Mobile-First Interface

### Main screen layout (tab-based navigation)

## Key Gameplay Mechanics

### Offline Progression
- Game tracks time while closed (up to 24 hour cap)
- Calculates full production at 100% rate
- On return: splash screen shows "While you were away: gained X cats, Y resources"
- Buildings that boost offline rate (Hermes' Messenger Waystation, Nyx primordial bonuses)
- Option to watch ad for 2x offline gains (mobile monetization)

### Save System
- Auto-save every 30 seconds locally
- Cloud save option (Firebase/similar) for cross-device sync
- Manual export/import as JSON for backup
- Save includes: all resources, buildings, research, reincarnation data, settings

### Number Formatting
- Abbreviated: 1K, 1M, 1B, 1T, 1Qa, 1Qi, etc.
- Option to toggle scientific notation
- Smooth animations when numbers increase

### Achievement System
- 100+ achievements tied to milestones
- Categories: cats collected, buildings built, gods unlocked, reincarnations, hidden challenges
- Achievements grant small permanent bonuses (0.5% CPS, +1% click power, etc.)
- Provides goals beyond main progression

### Random Events
- Occasional pop-ups: "A wild divine cat appears! Tap to claim bonus cats"
- "The gods smile upon you: 2x production for 30 seconds"
- "Offering from mortals: +500 Prayers"
- Events more frequent with Chaos primordial bonuses
- Not intrusive, purely beneficial

### Quality of Life
- Tooltips explain everything clearly
- "Buildings needed" calculator (shows how many more temples to afford next research)
- Notifications for major unlocks
- Performance stats visible for optimization theorycrafting

## Visual Style & Aesthetics

### Art Direction
- Clean, minimalist design with Greek-inspired decorative elements
- Warm color palette: golds, bronzes, marble whites, Mediterranean blues
- Cat illustrations range from simple/cute to majestic/divine depending on tier
- Subtle particle effects for divine/magical moments (ritual clicks, upgrades)
- Not overly cluttered - information density without visual noise

### Visual Themes by God
Each Olympian has signature colors/iconography:
- Hermes: winged sandals, caduceus, swift motion lines - yellows/oranges
- Athena: owl, olive branch, armor - greys/silvers
- Zeus: lightning bolts, eagle, clouds - electric blues/whites
- Ares: spear/shield, blood red accents
- *(Each god's buildings/UI elements reflect their theme)*

### Cat Visuals
- Simple cat icon for main counter (scales smoothly with big numbers)
- Different cat breeds/types illustrated for special cats from each god
- Sparkle/glow effects for rare/divine cat variants
- Satisfying animation when cats are generated

### UI Polish
- Smooth transitions between tabs
- Haptic feedback on mobile for button presses
- Progress bars with Greek key pattern borders
- Marble texture backgrounds (subtle, not distracting)
- Icons for all resources clearly distinguishable at small sizes

### Accessibility
- Colorblind-friendly palette options
- Text scaling options
- High contrast mode
- No reliance on color alone for important information

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- **Riverpod** for state management (Flutter's recommended modern approach)
- Game state holds: resources, buildings, research, god progression, reincarnation data
- Reactive updates: when cats change, UI automatically rebuilds
- Immutable state patterns to prevent bugs

### Data Models
```dart
GameState:
  - resources: Map<ResourceType, double>
  - buildings: Map<BuildingType, int>
  - unlockedGods: List<God>
  - currentGod: God
  - researchCompleted: Set<ResearchNode>
  - reincarnationData: ReincarnationState
  - achievementsUnlocked: Set<Achievement>

BuildingDefinition:
  - id, name, description
  - baseCost: Map<ResourceType, double>
  - costMultiplier (1.15 for exponential scaling)
  - baseProduction: double
  - godRequired: God?
```

### Game Loop
- Use Flutter's `Ticker` for frame-based updates (60 FPS)
- Every tick: calculate elapsed time, update resources based on production rates
- Optimized calculation: aggregate all building production, apply multipliers once
- Background timer continues when app minimized (mobile platform-specific)

### Save/Load
- JSON serialization of entire game state
- Local: `shared_preferences` package for auto-save
- Cloud: Firebase Firestore for optional cross-platform sync
- Versioned saves to handle updates/migrations

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading for tech tree (don't render 1000 nodes at once)
- Virtual scrolling for long building lists
- Memoization for expensive calculations (total production rate)
- Asset caching for images/icons

### Platform-Specific Code
- Native notifications (iOS/Android) for offline progress alerts
- Web: localStorage for saves, no notifications
- Adaptive UI widgets that respond to screen size

## Monetization & Distribution

### Monetization Strategy (Optional/Ethical)
- **Completely free to play** - No paywalls, all content accessible
- **Optional ads:**
  - Watch ad for 2x offline progress bonus
  - Watch ad for temporary production boost (2x for 1 hour)
  - Completely optional, never forced
- **Optional cosmetic purchases:**
  - Alternative UI themes (dark mode, alternate color schemes)
  - Special cat skins/animations (purely visual)
  - Support the developer tier ($2.99) - small permanent bonus + remove ads
- **No pay-to-win** - Cannot buy cats, resources, or progression directly
- **No energy/stamina systems** - Play as much as you want

### Distribution Plan

**Web (Primary Platform):**
- Host on GitHub Pages or similar (free hosting)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for mobile-like experience
- Shareable URL, no installation required
- Easiest to update and iterate

**Android:**
- Google Play Store (free with $25 one-time developer fee)
- APK also available on GitHub releases for sideloading
- Flutter compiles natively for good performance

**iOS:**
- Apple App Store ($99/year developer account required)
- TestFlight beta testing before full release
- Most expensive platform but completes the multiplatform vision

**Launch Strategy:**
- Start with web version for rapid iteration and feedback
- Polish based on player feedback
- Then release Android (easier approval)
- Finally iOS (stricter review process)
