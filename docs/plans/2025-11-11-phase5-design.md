- Active players see 25-30% faster progression with optimal prophecy use
- Idle players accumulate large Wisdom reserves
- Conquest bonuses make prophecies cheaper (-10% cooldowns from Oracle's Peak)

#### Phase 5E: Mid Apollo (25M - 50M cats)
**Duration:** 8-16 hours active play

**Player Actions:**
- Unlock Muses' Sanctuary (8M cats)
- Scale Apollo buildings to 25-40 total
- Regularly activate Tier 3 prophecies (Oracle's Revelation, Celestial Surge)
- Work toward Library of Alexandria conquest (1M cats, 2K Wisdom, 10K Divine Essence)
- Complete all Knowledge branch research

**Wisdom Economy:**
- Generation: 3,000-7,000 Wisdom/sec
- Accumulation: 200,000-500,000 total Wisdom
- Spending: 500-1,500 Wisdom per major prophecy

**Player Experience:**
- Prophecy system feels natural and powerful
- Apollo's Grand Vision becomes accessible (2,000 Wisdom cost, 4hr cooldown)
- Wisdom economy is self-sustaining
- Strategic optimization of prophecy timing

#### Phase 5F: Late Apollo (50M - 100M cats)
**Duration:** 10-20 hours active play

**Player Actions:**
- Heavy investment in Celestial Observatory (40M cats base)
- Scale Apollo buildings to 40-60 total
- Conquer Library of Alexandria (massive bonuses)
- Activate Apollo's Grand Vision routinely
- Prepare for Artemis unlock (100M cats)

**Wisdom Economy:**
- Generation: 7,000-15,000+ Wisdom/sec
- Accumulation: 500,000-1,000,000+ total Wisdom
- Spending: 2,000 Wisdom for Apollo's Grand Vision, sustainable

**Player Experience:**
- Complete mastery of prophecy system
- All 10 prophecies unlocked and used strategically
- Wisdom is abundant; focus shifts back to cat generation
- Achievements unlocking (Wisdom Hoarder, Renaissance Deity)
- Anticipation for next god (Artemis at 100M)

### Economic Balance

**Wisdom Generation vs Consumption:**

| Phase | Wisdom/sec | Prophecy Usage | Net Wisdom/hour |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Early Athena | 10-50 | None | +36K to +180K |
| Mid Athena | 50-200 | Research only | +180K to +720K |
| Apollo Unlock | 500-1,000 | Frequent (Tier 1-2) | +1.2M to +2.4M |
| Early Apollo | 1,000-3,000 | Regular (All tiers) | +2.4M to +7.2M |
| Mid Apollo | 3,000-7,000 | Optimized rotation | +7.2M to +16.8M |
| Late Apollo | 7,000-15,000+ | Grand Vision routine | +16.8M to +36M+ |

**Balance Goal:** Players should never feel Wisdom-starved after initial Apollo unlock. Prophecy costs are calibrated so active players can use prophecies every 30 min - 2 hours without depleting reserves.

**Prophecy Value Analysis:**
- **Tier 1 prophecies:** 5-10% effective DPS increase (minor convenience)
- **Tier 2 prophecies:** 15-25% effective DPS increase (solid value)
- **Tier 3 prophecies:** 25-40% effective DPS increase (major optimization)
- **Optimal rotation:** ~30% faster progression than passive play

**Building Cost Scaling:**
- All buildings use 1.15x exponential multiplier (industry standard)
- Example: Hall of Wisdom costs 75K (1st) → 86.25K (2nd) → 99.2K (3rd)
- By 25th building: ~1M cats per Hall of Wisdom

**Research Cost Gates:**
- Knowledge branch nodes affordable at 2-5M cat range
- Extension nodes require 3-8M cat range
- No research should hard-block progression

### Prestige/Reincarnation Integration

**First Reincarnation Timing:**
- Typical first prestige: 50-100M cats (mid-to-late Apollo phase)
- Players will have experienced full Phase 5 content before prestiging

**What Resets:**
- All cats (back to 0)
- All buildings (count reset to 0)
- All resources (Wisdom → 0, Divine Essence → 0, etc.)
- God progression resets (back to Hermes)

**What Persists:**
- All research completed (including Knowledge branch) ✓
- All achievements unlocked ✓
- Primordial upgrades purchased ✓
- Patron bonuses ✓

**Post-Prestige Progression:**
- 2nd run reaches Athena in ~30-50% of time (thanks to primordial bonuses)
- Research persistence means no re-researching Knowledge branch
- Achievements grant permanent Wisdom/sec bonuses (carry over)
- Players reach Apollo 2-3x faster on subsequent runs

**Late-Game Balance:**
- After 3-5 prestiges, players can reach Apollo in 1-2 hours
- Wisdom economy scales with primordial bonuses
- Prophecy system remains valuable across all prestige levels

### Difficulty Curve

**Early Athena:** Gentle introduction, slow Wisdom generation
**Mid Athena:** Moderate scaling, research choices matter
**Apollo Unlock:** Excitement spike, new mechanic unlocked
**Early Apollo:** Learning prophecy optimization
**Mid-Late Apollo:** Mastery and strategic depth
**Artemis Transition:** Ready for next phase (100M+ cats)

**Playtester Goals:**
- Phase 5 should take 30-50 hours to complete fully (1M → 100M cats)
- Prophecy system should feel rewarding, not mandatory
- Wisdom economy should feel abundant by mid-Apollo
- Research should offer meaningful choices, not obvious paths

## Appendix: Design Decisions Log

**Decision 1: Wisdom as Tier 2 Resource**
- Rationale: Needs to feel valuable but not overly complex. Tier 2 (alongside Divine Essence, Ambrosia) signals mid-game content without intimidating new players.

**Decision 2: 10 Prophecies**
- Rationale: 8-10 range chosen for variety without overwhelming. 10 provides nice distribution across 3 tiers.

**Decision 3: Instant Prophecy Activation**
- Rationale: Simpler than queuing system. Avoids complexity of managing multiple prophecy queues.

**Decision 4: Individual Cooldowns**
- Rationale: Allows strategic rotation. Players can plan prophecy usage around cooldowns.

**Decision 5: No Timed Buff Stacking**
- Rationale: Prevents exponential power creep. Keeps balance manageable.

**Decision 6: 4 Buildings Per God**
- Rationale: Consistent with existing god structure. Provides progression without bloat.

**Decision 7: Apollo 20x Wisdom Production**
- Rationale: Creates clear economic shift. Apollo feels significantly more powerful than Athena.

**Decision 8: New Prophecy Tab (8th Tab)**
- Rationale: Dedicated space for complex system. Avoids cramming into existing tabs.

**Decision 9: 3 New Territories**
- Rationale: Meaningful additions without overwhelming conquest tab. Each territory has clear thematic tie.

**Decision 10: Knowledge Research Persists Through Prestige**
- Rationale: Standard prestige behavior (all research persists). Prevents tedious re-grinding.
